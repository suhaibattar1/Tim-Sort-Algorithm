The provided code implements Timsort, a hybrid sorting algorithm that combines merge sort and insertion sort. Timsort has an average-case time complexity of O(n log n) and a worst-case time complexity of O(n log n). 

The algorithm first divides the array into smaller subarrays of size at most MIN_MERGE (which is 32 in this case) and sorts them using insertion sort. Then, it repeatedly merges adjacent sorted subarrays until the entire array is sorted. 

The insertion sort step takes O(n) time for each subarray, and the merge step takes O(n log n) time overall, resulting in a total time complexity of O(n log n). Additionally, the space complexity is O(n) due to the temporary array used for merging. Therefore, the provided Timsort implementation achieves efficient sorting performance for a wide range of input sizes.
